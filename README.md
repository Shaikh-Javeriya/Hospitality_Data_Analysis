# AtliQ Grands Hotel Dashboard #

***

## Project Overview ##
AtliQ Grands, a prominent five-star hotel chain in India, has been in the hospitality industry for over 20 years. Recently, they have faced challenges due to competitors' strategic moves and ineffective decision-making, resulting in declining market share and revenue in the luxury and business hotel segments.

To address these challenges, the management sought to leverage Business and Data Intelligence for insights from historical data. This Power BI dashboard provides actionable insights to help AtliQ Grands regain their market share and revenue.
